## contrived-di-example

This is just a small project where I've practiced Design Patterns by implementing an example of constructor based Dependency Injection using the Factory & Strategy Pattern in order to achieve Inversion of Control.

Benefits of using Dependency Injection;
- Separation of Concerns
- Configurable components making the application easily extendable (reducing rigidity)
- Unit testing made easy with mock objects
